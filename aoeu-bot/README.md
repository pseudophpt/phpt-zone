This is an auto-typer for https://typing-speed-test.aoeu.eu/

`aoeu-bot.js`: Automatically types words at a specified CPM (characters per minute)

`aoeu-bot2.js`: Automatically enters all characters you type as correct in a hidden box.

To use this bot, inspect element and copy the code into the javascript console. Tested working on Mozilla Firefox on Arch.

**Note**: You should not, under any circumstances, paste code whose **content you don't trust or understand** into a javascript console, or any other console for that matter. Please read the scripts before running them in your browser. That being said, I have no legal liability for any of the consequences caused by this script under GPLv3. That doesn't mean I'm evil though ;)
